# Disk91 IoT_SDK not only for STM32

*Version 1.7 - in development. For stable version go to version-1.6 branch*

This project is a low level SDK with a harwdare abstraction layer designed to make IoT project. The purpose is to quickly be able to create communicating IoT device over LPWAN (LoRaWAn, Sigfox...) for fast prototyping but also being able to bring that firmware to production will all the necessary components avaoilable out-of-the-box. This SDK try to be fully configurable with header files. The objectif is to propose an abstraction layer between the software implementation and the MCU execution allowing to port the firmware on different plateform. 

![itsdk_architecture](Doc/It-sdk-architecture.png) "IT-SDK Architecture"

The SDK is currently implementing STM32L architecture. The abstraction layer allows to quickly add new platforms. 

It implements different usefull function with (I hope) a cleaner code than the usual ST SDK components. 

Most is done to preserve code size, the SDK can target small flash MCU from 16KB for simple applications.

# Project organization
Previously the devel branch was the living branch and master was stable. This way sound not optimal (at least for my github commit graph ;)/ So starting in 1.6 here is the new organization:
- devel is a bit advanced on master for not yet tested commit
- master is the new devel branch containing tested commit but not yet verified, you **must not** go in production with master.
- version branch for each new version + release 


# Start your project by configuring a skeleton with Cube Mx 

* Sys Clock Mux : HSI16
* Watchdog : configure IWDG with LSI 37KHz, IWDG_WINDOW value 4095, IWDG_PRESCALER value 256
* Rtc timer : TIM21 is enable with clock source internal for calibration
* LowPower : 
  * LPUART1/USART1/USART2 (Async 9600 - 8/N/1) for WakeUp => clock setting needs to be HSI and max speed needs to be 9600
  * RTC WakeUp => Activate ClkSource, Calendar, Internal WakeUp, Clk config : LSI, RTC/NVIC => Interrupt activated, Async prediv: 127, Sync prediv: 255
  * GPIO WakeUp => Activate the GPIO as ExtInterrupt, set with Pull & Trigger en Fall/Rise, activate NVIC EXI1_15
* adc : Select an adc like for temperature and Vcc to get the needed headers

When generating the Project
* Code generator:
  * select Generate peripheral initalization as par of .c/.h
  * Set all free pins as analog
* Advanced Settings:
  * Check Not Generated Function Call for ADC


# Import the SDK (this repository)

1. Clone this repository into the root of your project.
2. For the next configuration, you need to do it ifor both Debug *and* Release configuration 
3. Add in project properties >> C/C++ General >> Path&Symbol >> Source location >> the repository ItSdk Src directory.
4. Add in project properties >> C/C++ Build >> Settings >> Tool Settings >> MCU GCC Compiler >> Includes Path >>  Add the ItSdk Inc directory.
5. Add in project properties >> C/C++ Build >> Settings >> Tool Settings >> MCU GCC Assembler >> Includes Path >> Add the ItSdk Inc directory.
6. In C/C++ Build / Settings / Build Step / pre-build steps you can add the command _touch "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/stm32-it-sdk/Src/it_sdk/console/console.c}"_ this will update the compile date on every build
7. You can get detail on size of code generated on build by adding a post-build step _"arm-none-eabi-size  --format=sysV ${BuildArtifactFileName}"_
8. You can take a loop on [various stm32 code optimization](https://www.disk91.com/2020/technology/programming/code-optimization-with-stm32-cube-ide/) also. 

# Configure the SDK

1. Copy one of the *ItSdk/Src/project_main.c.template* file into Core/Src/project_main.c and make the modification you want to get started.
2. Copy the *ItSdk/Inc/it_sdk/config.h.template* file into *Core/Inc/it_sdk/config.h*
3. Copy the *ItSdk/Inc/it_sdk/configDrivers.h.template* file into *Core/Inc/it_sdk/configDrivers.h* [needed when using some of the drivers]
4. Copy the *ItSdk/Inc/it_sdk/configSigfox.h.template* file into *Core/Inc/it_sdk/configSigfox.h* [needed when using sigfox drivers]
5. Copy the *ItSdk/Inc/it_sdk/configLoRaWan.h.template* file into *Core/Inc/it_sdk/configLoRaWan.h* [needed when using LoRaWAn drivers]
6. Edit these files and fill the different settings according to your environment and your choices.


# Modify the Cube Mx skeleton
Things to not forget once a cubeMx project has been created
* Gpio.c
   - During deep-sleep, all the gpios not listed in _ITSDK_LOWPOWER_GPIO_X_KEEP_ will be switched analog. The gpio attached to devices (I2C,SPI...) will be reconfigured when these device will be reactivated but the standard gpio will need to be reconfigured.
   - By default the wake up procedure call *void MX_GPIO_Init(void)* function created by CubeMX. If the default setting is good for you you can keep it but you will have to remove the gpio SET & RESET functions.
   - Another solution (better) is to create a function named *void stm32l_lowPowerRestoreGpioConfig()*:
    ```C
    void stm32l_lowPowerRestoreGpioConfig() {


        /* GPIO Ports Clock Enable */
        __HAL_RCC_GPIOA_CLK_ENABLE();
        __HAL_RCC_GPIOB_CLK_ENABLE();
        __HAL_RCC_GPIOC_CLK_ENABLE();
        __HAL_RCC_GPIOH_CLK_ENABLE();

        // reconfigure the gpio deep-sleep have switched analog
        ...

        // reactivate the Interrupt line you need
        HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(EXTI0_1_IRQn, 0, 0);
        HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ(EXTI0_1_IRQn);
        ...
        HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(EXTI4_15_IRQn, 0, 0);
        HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ(EXTI4_15_IRQn);
   ```
  
* Main.c
   => includes
```C
  /* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
	#include <it_sdk/config.h>
	#include <it_sdk/itsdk.h>
  /* USER CODE END Includes */
```  
   => main
```C
    MX_IWDG_Init();
  	/* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
  	  itsdk_setup();
  	/* USER CODE END 2 */

  	/* Infinite loop */
  	/* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
  	while (1)
  	{
	  /* USER CODE END WHILE */
	  /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
	  itsdk_loop();
  	}
  	/* USER CODE END 3 */
```

  
Other modifications (need to be done on every CubeMx project regeneration):
  - GPIO - (in gpio.c) Cube Mx is setting/resetting the Gpio state on init. You need to manually comment the line in *gpio.c* to avoid the pin to be modified on MCU wake-up. The other solution is to let the gpio init as-is and add a function *void stm32l_lowPowerRestoreGpioConfig()* containing the gpio reconfiguration after wakeup.

  - ADC - if you choose to not use ADC_OPTIMIZED_CODE_FOR_SIZE : remove generated adc.c/h and remove adc references in main.c 
  
# Documentation

The documentation about the different components is available in **[/Doc](Doc/)** directory.
The function API are not documented in the _.h_ files but more generally in the _.c_ files.
Work in progress...

# Examples 

The examples are published on different Git repo to simplify the distribution of the SDK.
