 * Use WDG is the most standard way : ensure the watchdog is
 * called regularly in the main loop until a given time.
 * WDG must be activated and configured in CubeMX
 * LSI is 37KHz
 * - The IWDG_WINDOW is disabled setting 4096 as value
 * - The IWDG_PRESCALER is set to be about 7ms => IWDG_PRESCALER_256 to cover up to 28s
 * - The Reload value is set to match 28s until being changed by the setup function (4096)
 * WDG is refreshed in the main loop so any cycle duration must be
 * lower than the wdg timer configuration, otherwise you need to manually refresh it
